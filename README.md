## Methods for Sparse 1D Signal Sampling and Reconstruction
Studied different approaches to effectively sample signals that are sparse in some basis and formulated the problem of reconstruction of this signal as an L1 norm-based minimization problem. Developed the code to numerically implement the solution in Python using cvxpy and other modules
, Alternately explored deep learning based approaches for signal reconstruction with the help of other team members in case of event-triggered sampling and sparse signal approximation
